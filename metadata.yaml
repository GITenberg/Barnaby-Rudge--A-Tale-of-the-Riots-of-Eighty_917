description: "Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty (commonly known as Barnaby\
  \ Rudge) is a historical novel by British novelist Charles Dickens. Barnaby Rudge\
  \ was one of two novels (the other was The Old Curiosity Shop) that Dickens published\
  \ in his short-lived (1840â€“1841) weekly serial Master Humphrey's Clock. Barnaby\
  \ Rudge is largely set during the Gordon Riots of 1780.\nBarnaby Rudge was the fifth\
  \ of Dickens' novels to be published. It had originally been planned to appear as\
  \ his first, but changes of publisher led to many delays, and it first appeared\
  \ in serial form in the Clock from February to November 1841.\nIt was Dickens' first\
  \ historical novel. His only other is the much later A Tale of Two Cities, also\
  \ set in revolutionary times. It is one of his less popular novels and has rarely\
  \ been adapted for film or television. The last production was a 1960 BBC production;\
  \ prior to that, silent films were made in 1911 and 1915.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC\
